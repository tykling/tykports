The dns_exporter v%%PORTVERSION%% has been installed!

It is possible to use dns_exporter for simple lookups
without a config file, but for response validation you
need a config file.

To create a config file you can copy the sample config at
%%ETCDIR%%/dns_exporter.yml.sample to 
%%ETCDIR%%/dns_exporter.yml and edit it as needed.
