===========================================================
The dns_exporter v%%PORTVERSION%% has been installed!

It is possible to use dns_exporter for simple lookups
without a config file, but for response validation you
need a config file.

A example config has been installed to %%ETCDIR%%/dns_exporter.yml
which you can edit it as needed.
