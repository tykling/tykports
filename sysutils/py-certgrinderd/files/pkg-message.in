The Certgrinderd server v%%PORTVERSION%% has been installed!

To configure it you have to copy the sample config at
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinderd.conf.sample to
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinderd.conf and edit it.

Certgrinderd needs a LetsEncrypt account, it can be created with certbot:
   certbot register --agree-tos --email letsencrypt@example.com

SSH keys for clients should be added to %%ETCDIR%%/.ssh/authorized_keys and
PermitUserEnvironment=CERTGRINDERD_DOMAINSET has to be set in sshd_config, see
