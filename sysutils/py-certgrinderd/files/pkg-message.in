The Certgrinderd server v%%PORTVERSION%% has been installed!

To configure it you have to copy the sample config at
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinderd.conf.sample to
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinderd.conf and edit it.

Certgrinderd needs a LetsEncrypt account, it can be created with certbot.

SSH keys for each client should be added to %%ETCDIR%%/.ssh/authorized_keys, for exampe:

from="2001:DB8::15",environment="CERTGRINDERD_DOMAINSETS=example.com,www.example.com;example.net",command="/usr/local/bin/certgrinderd $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND",restrict ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOegnR+qnK2FEoaSrVwHgCIxjFkVEbW4VO31/Hd2mAwk ansible-generated on webproxy2.example.com

To make sshd pick up the environment= setting the option PermitUserEnvironment=CERTGRINDERD_DOMAINSETS needs to be added to sshd_config.
