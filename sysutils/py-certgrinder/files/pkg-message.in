The Certgrinder client has been installed.

To configure it you have to copy the sample config at
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinder.conf.sample to
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinder.conf and edit it to your liking.

You can also create a %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/certgrinder symlink
to %%ETCDIR%% and use that in configs so a future Python
version change does not change certificate paths.
