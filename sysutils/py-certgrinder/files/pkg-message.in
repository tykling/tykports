The Certgrinder client (version %%PORTVERSION%%) has been installed!

To configure it you have to copy the sample config at
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinder.conf.sample to
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinder.conf and edit it to your liking.

Certgrinder needs an SSH keypair in %%ETCDIR%%/.ssh/
You can copy an existing keypair or generate a new one:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /usr/local/etc/certgrinder/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""

Keys, certificates and OCSP responses will be put in
%%ETCDIR%%/certificates/ and you can place hooks in
%%ETCDIR%%/hooks.d/
