The Certgrinder client v%%PORTVERSION%% has been installed!

To configure it you have to copy the sample config at
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinder.conf.sample to
%%ETCDIR%%/certgrinder.conf and edit it.

Certgrinder needs an SSH keypair in %%ETCDIR%%/.ssh/
You can copy an existing keypair or generate a new one:
sudo -u certgrinder ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N ""

Keys, certificates and OCSP responses will be put in
%%ETCDIR%%/certificates/ and you can place executable hooks in
%%ETCDIR%%/hooks.d/
