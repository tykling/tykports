# Certgrinder client: certgrinder

This is the client part of the Certgrinder project.

Certgrinder is a set of Python scripts to handle Letsencrypt certificate
signing on a central host (the Certgrinder server), rather than on the
machines which need the certificates (the Certgrinder clients). This is
accomplished by redirecting the LetsEncrypt challenge to the Certgrinder
server. For DNS-01 challenges this is done with a CNAME record and for
HTTP-01 challenges it is done with a HTTP 301 redirect.

Certgrinder clients calls the Certgrinderd server (typically over SSH)
with a CSR on stdin and (if all goes well) get a signed certificate on
stdout.

This approach simplifies getting certificates in loadbalanced, anycast or
network restricted environments. It can also help when migrating
services, since it is possible to issue certificates to the new servers
before changing DNS.
